<p>Screenshots of a Windows build which purported to be Threshold were leaked in July 2014, showing the previously presented 
Start menu and windowed Windows Store apps followed by a further screenshot in September 2014 of a build identifying 
itself as "Windows Technical Preview", numbered 9834, showing a new virtual desktop system, a notification center, and a
new File Explorer icon.</p>

<h3>Release</h3>
On June 1, 2015, Microsoft announced that Windows 10 would be released on July 29, 2015. Microsoft began an 
advertising campaign centering on Windows 10, "Upgrade Your World", on July 20, 2015 with the premiere of television
commercials in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The commercials 
focused on the tagline "A more human way to do", emphasizing new features and technologies supported by Windows 10 that 
sought to provide a more "personal" experience to users. The campaign culminated with launch events in thirteen
cities on July 29, which celebrated "the unprecedented role our biggest fans played in the development of Windows 10".</p>

<h3>Storage Requirements</h3>  
<p>To reduce the storage footprint of the operating system, Windows 10 automatically compresses system files. The system can 
reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5 GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6 GB for 64-bit systems. The 
level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests 
how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset
functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates
to remain installed following the operation, and further reducing the amount of space required for Windows 10 by up to
12 GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure 
low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed WIM image typically used 
for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to 
view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether
certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an SD card by default.</p>

<h3>Multimedia and Gaming </h3>
<p>Windows 10 provides heavier integration with the Xbox ecosystem. Xbox SmartGlass is succeeded by the Xbox Console 
Companion (formerly the Xbox app), which allows users to browse their game library (including both PC and Xbox console
games), and Game DVR is also available using a keyboard shortcut, allowing users to save the last 30 seconds of gameplay 
as a video that can be shared to Xbox Live, OneDrive, or elsewhere. Windows 10 also allows users to control and 
play games from an Xbox One console over a local network. The Xbox Live SDK allows application developers to 
incorporate Xbox Live functionality into their apps, and future wireless Xbox One accessories, such as controllers, are 
supported on Windows with an adapter.Microsoft also intends to allow cross-buys and save synchronization between
 Xbox One and Windows 10 versions of games; Microsoft Studios games such as ReCore and Quantum Break are intended as 
being exclusive to Windows 10 and Xbox One.
Candy Crush Saga and Microsoft Solitaire Collection are also automatically installed upon installation of Windows 10. 
Windows 10 adds native game recording and screenshot capture ability using the newly introduced game bar. Users can also
 have the OS continuously record gameplay in the background, which then allows the user to save the last few moments of 
gameplay to the storage device.</p>
