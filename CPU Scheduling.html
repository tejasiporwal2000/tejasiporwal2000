<p>To begin the process, type sysdm.cpl in Run box and hit Enter to open the System Properties. Select the Advanced tab 
and under Performance, click on Settings. In the Performance Options box, select the Advanced tab again. You will see a 
section Processor Scheduling.</p>
<p>There are 2 settings you can choose:<br>
1-Adjust for best performance of Programs<br>
2-Adjust for best performance of Background Services</p>
<p>Just in case you wish to know, the PriorityControl key defines the foreground vs. background priority differential.
The possible default values for Win32PrioritySeparation REG_DWORD 0, 1, or 2, with the default being  0x2.<br>
This default value specifies the priority to give to the application running in the foreground. This application 
receives more process or time relative to other applications running in the background, explains TechNet.. The values 
here correlate to the following options in the Tasking dialog box: Value Meaning<br>
0  -        Foreground and background applications equally responsive<br>
1  -        Foreground application more responsive than background<br>
2  -        Best foreground application response time.</p>

<p>Using this feature, you can set up Windows, so that it is optimized to run programs or foreground services OR 
Background Services, like printing or backing up, while you work in another program, simply by adjusting Processor 
Scheduling. This way, Windows then knows how to distribute or allocate the available resources, to best perform these 
tasks.<br>
If you are using a desktop, you may leave the setting at its default or choose Adjust for best performance of Programs.
Let us know if this results in a smoother, faster response time for your programs or foreground services.<br>
However, if you use your PC as a Server or if you constantly have background services, such as printing or disk backup
that run while you work and you want them to respond faster, you can have Windows share processor resources equally
between background and foreground programs by choosing the other option, ie. Adjust for best performance of Background
Services.<br>

So you see, Windows now gives you an easy way to set Processor Scheduling. If you are an advanced user and wish to set 
the values manually, you many use the follow the manual way in this post on how to get best performance for programs or
background services.</p>
