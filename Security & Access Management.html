<h3>Security </h3>
<p>The growth in security breaches continues to be an ever-present issue for every organization. These threats
are very real and have the attention of CIOs today. Most attacks happen as result of improperly configured PCs or 
because users unknowingly expose their devices by downloading payloads or launching web pages that infect a system.
Further, older releases of Windows were never designed to fully address the wide variety of spam, malware, or phishing 
that plague organizations today. Organizations also struggle balancing risk management, governance, and other security 
initiatives that impact business goals. Windows 10 ushers in many new changes that help address security and data 
concerns that exist with pre-Windows 10 environments: </p>

The underlying philosophy for Windows 10 security is that all applications must earn trust before they can be used. 
This means a multitude of mechanisms are in order including protecting the device, application, transport, and scenario
where applications can be executed.

<h3>Access Management </h3>
<p>As application, device, and network access continues to diversify, there exists an increased capability for the 
delivery of a simple, easy, and secure way to access applications and data.</p>   
<p>1-Multiple user credentials </p>
<p>2-Diverse delivery infrastructures </p> 
<p>3-Multi-factor authentication </p>
<p>4-Binary access</p>
Diversity of device controls 

<h3>Today’s Identity Problem </h3>
<p>Most enterprises today have at least one or two SaaS apps in use. Typically, a line of business owner manages app
provisioning and user-access manually. At best, they may coordinate with IT for help desk and ticket management for 
new-user on boarding, separation, or password resets. While this might be OK for one or two SaaS apps, many enterprises 
are now deploying their third, fourth or fifth app, making the proliferation of user credentials overly complex. 
This complexity risks compliance and security as no one in IT can guarantee what employees have access to which apps, 
or what data might be saved on unmanaged, unencrypted devices. Identity management capabilities within Windows 10 make
dealing with access and security across app types, networks, services, and data significantly more manageable. It does 
this by enabling: </p>
<h3>Enterprise Single Sign-On </h3> 
<p>Simplify business mobility with included identity provider (IDP) or integrate with existing on-premises identity 
providers so you can aggregate SaaS, Native Mobile, and Windows 10 apps into a single catalogue. </P>
<h3>Self-Service App Store</h3> 
<p>Build a branded self-service app store so employees can subscribe to applications across devices with automated
or manual provisioning. 
<h3>Identity Management</h3> 
<p>with Adaptive Access Establish trust between users, devices and the hybrid cloud for a seamless user experience and
enable powerful conditional access controls leveraging third-party device enrollment and SSO adaptors.</p> 
<h3>Enterprise-Grade Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure</h3> 
<p>Leverage VMware Identity Manager, the same identity management solution as vCloud Air and vCloud Suite, in the most
advanced data centers and private clouds.</p>
