<h3>Information</h3>
<p>Windows 10 is a personal computer operating system created by Microsoft as a part of the Windows NT family. Microsoft 
released Windows 10 as a follow-up version of Windows 8.1 in July 2015.

Microsoft is trying to use Windows 10 as a unified operating system for a variety of different devices, including PCs, phones and video consoles.
Windows 10 is the latest OS version from Microsoft. These videos gives you all the indepth information on this new
operating system and its procedures, right from what all hardware and other system components are required to install 
this OS in your system, to its advanced features and other uses. Windows 10 combines the features from its two previous
versions for making it further user friendly for desktops as well as laptops and mobile devices.</p>

<h3>Some Features about Windows 10</h3>
<p>Features of Windows 10 include the return of the Start menu, a new browser, Edge, which replaces the longtime standard
Internet Explorer, a new inclusion Cortana which is a virtual assistant analogous to Apple's Siri, and more.</p>

<h3>Start Menu</h3>
<p>If you are using Windows 8 and hate its full-screen Start interface, you're in luck with Windows 10: just like the good 
old days, the new Start menu locates on the left side of the screen.
And if you liked Windows 8's approach, it can still satisfy you: you can still access Live Tiles and the touch-centric
Metro interface from a panel on the right side of the Start Menu.</p>

<h3>Task View</h3>
<p>There's a button that lives on the taskbar which is called Task View. Click it, and you can get a quick look at all of 
your open files, windows, and desktops… in one word, it will display all open windows and allow you to switch between 
them, or switch between multiple workspaces.</p>

<h3>Cortana</h3>
<p>Windows 10 incorporates Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant, Cortana, which supports both text and voice input. 
Say "Hey, Cortana" after turning on the voice recognition feature and you can issue commands on your PC 
(personal computer).
Cortana which was first introduced with Windows Phone 8.1, and many of its features are a direct carryover from Windows
 Phone, including integration with Bing, setting reminders, notebook features for managing personal information, and 
searching for files, playing music, launching apps, and sending emails. Cortana is set as a universal search box located 
between the Start and Task View.</p>

Microsoft Edge
If you ask that is Internet Explorer still around, the answer will be no and yes. Why? Because debuted Internet Explorer
is replaced by the brand-new Microsoft Edge which is set as the default web browser in Windows 10. Internet Explorer is 
still a part of Windows for compatibility reasons.
Edge includes tools like Web Note, which allows you to markup websites (for example: click the button, and you'll be able 
to annotate what you're looking at and share your notes through email, or through OneNote), and Reading View, which 
allows you to view certain websites without the clutter of ads. The browser integrates directly with Cortana.

Windows 10 update
Then what version of Windows will come after Windows 10? There is no other Windows after Windows 10. Microsoft has
 announced that it will permanently update Windows 10 instead of releasing a new operating system as a successor.
 Windows 10 continues to receive new versions, and users do not have to pay extra.
In a 2015 blog post, Microsoft's Terry Myerson explained that Windows is transitioning to a service model. The company
 will update Windows 10 on the second Tuesday of each month, with major updates released in April and October of each 
year instead of moving towards "Windows 11". For example, in 2018, Microsoft released the Anniversary Update in April
and the Creators Update in October.
The mainstream version of Windows 10 is marked as YYMM version, YY for the release year and MM for the release month. 
For example, the latest mainstream version of Windows 10 is version 1809.
