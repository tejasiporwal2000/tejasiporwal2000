<p>Windows 10 is coming this summer – first to the desktops and then to the portable devices. The components of Windows10
have the capability to detect screen size and will accordingly scale themselves on the device so as to fit properly and 
rovide you with better experience. There are some other points of interest when it comes to device management in Windows 
10. Today, in this post, we will cover enterprise mobile device management options in Windows 10.</p>

<h3>Enrollment and removal of users in Windows 10</h3>
<p>For enterprise users, Microsoft is banking on usage of Windows Azure Active Directory as a base for user groups. It would
be easier for enterprises to enroll and de-enroll people using the directory.
If an employee leaves or moves to another department, his or her device needs to be cleaned. This happens using the
auto-configuration system. When you remove a user from MDM, it removes all data from related device. Data that could be 
otherwise be used to compromise or utilize the enterprise resources is removed when a user is deleted from the mobile 
device management system. It will not however, remove data personal to the user and his or her own apps. Only corporate 
data that had been configured through MDM would be removed, so that the user is not inconvenienced after he or she 
leaves, or moves to other departments of the enterprise.</p>

<h3>Mobile Device Management (MDM)</h3>
<p>Windows 10 is more fun on mobile devices with touchscreens compared to PCs. Nevertheless, it promises to provide a 
good experience on all type of devices using its auto-detection capabilities and thereby restricting or increasing the
number of features available for a device. Not all the features in a full-fledged computer will be available on lower 
configuration machines such as phones and tablet. There will be one Windows 10 version that will adapt itself to the 
device being used.</h3>
Mobile device management policies in Windows 10 are based on Windows 8.1, but are extended to provide different experiences to different users. For example, MDM capabilities for enterprise users will be much different from a personal license. The features for enterprise versions could include: Multiple user management, extent of control over Windows store to different user groups, management of virtual private networks and so on.
This will be made possible via the Configuration Service Provider in Windows 10. It is an interface to create, read, modify, and delete configuration settings on a device. Using this, the OS will apply different configurations to different devices. For example, the Storage enterprise configuration service provider is used to enable or disable memory cards. Based on the device type, MDM will allow or disable the storage enterprise configuration. Because PCs won’t have memory cards inserted, this service will not be present, and because mobile phones will contain such cards, the service will be available. This would not only help in configuring the devices better, it would also save on resources of the device in question.
